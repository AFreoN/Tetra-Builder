# Tetra-Builder
In this innovative puzzle game, players start with a single cube and can expand by adding additional cubes to any of the six faces. The game involves careful planning, as the placement of each new cube depends on the current structure. The ultimate goal is to encase a die located at the bottom of the stage by integrating it into the player's structure, guided by the placement of a green cube. This demands strategic thinking and spatial awareness from the player.
